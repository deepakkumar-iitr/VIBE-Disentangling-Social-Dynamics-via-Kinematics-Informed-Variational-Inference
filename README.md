**VIBE** is a kinematics-aware framework designed for Group Emotion Recognition (GER). Unlike current AI models that act as black boxes and get distracted by background environments, VIBE utilizes causal structuring and mathematical constraints to filter out background noise and isolate the genuine emotions and sociological mechanics of a crowd.

## 🏗️ Architecture

VIBE is a multimodal, causally-structured framework that processes video, audio, and text through specialized encoders. The architecture is illustrated below:

![VIBE Architecture](VIBE_Architecture8.jpg)

*Overview of the proposed VIBE architecture. The framework processes features from three pre-trained encoders: Global Context (X_glob) via VideoMAE V2, Local Agent Tubes (X_loc) via DINOv2, and Acoustic Prosody (X_aud) via HuBERT. γ denotes the Synchrony Matrix used for dynamic gating, while X_text represents the textual anchor features. The Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses the representation and filters noise, while L_ortho enforces orthogonality between the environmental (Z_env) and affective (Z_aff) latent spaces to ensure disentanglement.*

## ✨ Key Innovations

- 🔀 **Causal Disentanglement**: Employs a Dual-Stream Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to strictly separate affective signals from environmental confounders.

- 📐 **Orthogonality Constraint**: Introduces a soft constraint that geometrically forces the "Agent" and "Context" latent spaces to remain disjoint, ensuring the model focuses on agent dynamics rather than background noise.

- ⚡ **Gamma-Gated Transformer**: Features a Transformer equipped with Decoupled Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN). This modulates neural attention based on a raw physical synchrony metric ($\gamma$), allowing the model to dynamically adapt based on the crowd's physical state.

- 🔤 **Text-Guided Semantic Alignment**: Projects learned features into a shared embedding space to enforce cosine similarity with pre-trained textual anchors, explicitly grounding abstract visual dynamics in human interpretability.

## 🎞️ Architecture & Modalities

VIBE integrates audio, video, and text modalities through specialized pre-trained backbones:

| Modality | Feature | Backbone | Description |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 🎥 Video (Global) | $X_{glob}$ | VideoMAE V2 | Scene-level dynamics via token sequences |
| 👤 Video (Local) | $X_{loc}$ | DINOv2 | Agent-centric visual tubes per tracked person |
| 🔊 Audio | $X_{aud}$ | HuBERT | Paralinguistic cues (pitch, energy) |
| 📝 Text | $X_{text}$ | RoBERTa | Crowd-level semantic descriptions |

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

VIBE sets a new state-of-the-art for group affect prediction on "in-the-wild" datasets, consistently outperforming prior methods:

| 📁 Dataset | 🎯 Accuracy | 📈 F1 Score |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **VGAF** | **70.17%** | 0.701 |
| **GECV** | **91.85%** | 0.915 |

> 💡 Performance consistently peaks when the model tracks around **8 agents** ($K=8$), effectively capturing the primary affective circle.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VIBE.git
cd VIBE

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run inference on a video
python inference.py --video path/to/video.mp4 --checkpoint checkpoints/vibe_best.pth
```

---

## 🧪 Reproduce Results

```bash
# Train on VGAF
python train.py --dataset vgaf --config configs/vgaf.yaml

# Train on GECV

## 🌍 Impact

By effectively separating human behavior from the surrounding environment, VIBE mitigates **"shortcut learning"** — preventing models from making biased guesses based on background details. This helps build more **transparent**, **accountable**, and **responsible** AI systems for emotion recognition that are robust across diverse, real-world locations.
